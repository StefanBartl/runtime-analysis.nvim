---@module 'runtime-analysis.telemetry.fingerprint'
--- Turns a call's arguments into a short, bounded, non-secret string key.
---
--- Deliberately NOT a serializer. Argument profiling exists to answer "do most
--- calls pass the same thing?", and that question is answerable from a shape
--- plus a digest. Storing the real values would mean writing file paths,
--- buffer contents and possibly tokens into `stdpath("cache")` — a profiler
--- that does that is a security bug wearing a feature's name.
---
--- Rules (see lua/runtime-analysis/telemetry/README.md, "Argument profiling, done honestly"):
---   nil/boolean/number              -> the value itself
---   string                          -> "<string:len:digest>" (never the text)
---   table                           -> "<table:n=3>" (shape, not contents)
---   function/userdata/thread        -> "<function>" / "<userdata>" / "<thread>"

--- Only this many leading bytes go into a string's digest; a buffer's worth
--- of text would otherwise be hashed on every profiled call. Kept small and
--- close to the old (pre-SEC-13) 40-byte cap on purpose: this module is on
--- the hot path whenever telemetry is running (see
--- runtime-analysis.telemetry.registry, which fingerprints every argument of
--- every wrapped call when a subscriber sets args=true), and "never store
--- the text" -- the property SEC-13 actually requires -- does not depend on
--- how many leading bytes get folded into the digest.

--- Beyond this many arguments the tail is summarized rather than described;
--- variadic call sites otherwise produce one distinct fingerprint per arity.
