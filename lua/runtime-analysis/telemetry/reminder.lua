---@module 'runtime-analysis.telemetry.reminder'
--- Tells you, once, that enough data has piled up to be worth reading.
---
--- The failure mode this feature invites is being switched on and forgotten:
--- it keeps costing overhead for months and the data never gets looked at. So
--- once a threshold is crossed the module says so — and says it *actionably*,
--- naming the exact commands for reading and stopping. A reminder that says
--- "you have data" without saying how to look at it just moves the forgetting
--- one step later.
---
--- Three rules, each with a reason:
---   - Checked where work already happens (flush time, `VimEnter`), never on
---     the hot path. A reminder a few minutes late costs nothing; a clock read
---     per wrapped call costs exactly what this design avoids.
---   - Fires once per threshold and persists that it fired, in the same cache
---     entry as the counts. A reminder that reappears every session is a nag,
---     and a nag gets muted.
---   - Escalates once, then stops for good. Two messages over months is a
---     reminder; more is nagging.
