---@module 'runtime-analysis.telemetry.report_style'
--- Resolve a `report_style` request ("auto" | "kit" | "mdview" | "file") to
--- a concrete destination `:RATelemetry open` can act on.
---
--- Mirrors `lib.nvim.progress.resolve_style`: prefer the richer external
--- integration when it is actually loadable, degrade silently rather than
--- erroring the caller — an external plugin's presence is never
--- stability-guaranteed, and that includes an explicit request for it, not
--- only "auto" (the same choice `progress.resolve_style` makes for an
--- explicit `"fidget"` request).
