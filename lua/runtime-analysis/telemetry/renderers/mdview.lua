---@module 'runtime-analysis.telemetry.renderers.mdview'
--- Bridges a rendered report to a browser tab via mdview.nvim's own
--- `:MDView standalone` — which already does exactly the right thing for
--- this, so the bridge is thin. See the "Browser report" section of
--- lua/lib/nvim/telemetry/README.md for the reasoning.
---
--- `:MDView standalone` hands a FILE PATH to the relay binary's own --watch
--- mode and steps out of the chain entirely: the relay watches the file on
--- disk and broadcasts changes to the browser itself. Combined with
--- `report_file = true` (telemetry rewrites that same path on every flush),
--- the browser tab becomes a live dashboard with no new machinery on either
--- side — neither plugin gains a poller, a socket, or a timer it did not
--- already have.
---
--- The **browser** tier of mdview. `renderers/preview_tab.lua` is the other
--- one — same plugin, no relay, no binary, and a snapshot instead of a live
--- file. See that file's header for which to reach for when.
---
--- Soft dependency, never hard: `pcall(require, "mdview")`, every call here
--- pcall-guarded, degrade to `false, err` rather than throwing. Same
--- discipline `lib.nvim.progress.styles.fidget` documents for fidget.nvim —
--- an external plugin's surface is not stability-guaranteed.
